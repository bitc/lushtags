synopsis:            Create ctags compatible tags files for Haskell programs
description:
    > Create ctags compatible tags files for Haskell programs
    >
    > Similar programs are [hasktags][1], [gasbag][2], [hothasktags][3], and GHC's
    > builtin ctags generation.
    >
    > lushtags differs from these by being designed to have smooth integration with
    > the [Vim Tagbar][4] plugin.
    >
    > Tagbar is nice because it deals with creating tags automatically. There is no
    > need to manually run commands or keep track of tag files. Just open any Haskell
    > file in Vim and the Tagbar window will instantly show an interactive browsable
    > list of all the functions and declarations in the file. This window also
    > updates automatically as you edit the file.
    >
    > The tags created by lushtags are marked with several extensions, so that when
    > used with Tagbar you get these features:
    >
    > - Type signatures are displayed for functions.
    > - Tags are properly scoped so that, for example, data declarations appear as a
    >   tree with their constructors scoped as children.
    > - Definitions that are exported from the module are marked as "public" and
    >   appear emphasized in Tagbar.
    > - Tag locations are internally stored as patterns, not line numbers, so that
    >   you can correctly jump to tags even if they have moved in the source code
    >   during editing.
